# Challenges

-   Deploy to netlify

-   Rewrite greeting to take an array of names to greet, joining the names into one string, by commas.

-   Improve the TVEpisode component to show more data from the given episode, including image and summary.

-   Write a component ReverseWord that takes a prop called originalWord and displays the original word and its reversed form.

-   (After making sure all is committed), extract out the components such as Greeting and TVEpisode into separate files - one per component.

-   Make a component that does something conditionally - e.g. shows a hot or cold emoji given a temperature.

-   Rewrite greeting to take an array of names to greet,displaying a ul populated with one li element per name. (you'll need to use a loop or - harder but much more common - array.map)

-   Write an TVEpisodesList component that takes an array of episodes and shows all of them, delegating work to the TVEpisode component to build the HTML for each episode.
