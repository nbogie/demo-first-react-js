# Challenges

1. Deploy to netlify

1. Rewrite greeting to take an array of names to greet, joining the names into one string, by commas.

1. Improve the TVEpisode component to show more data from the given episode, including image and summary.

1. Write a component ReverseWord that takes a prop called originalWord and displays the original word and its reversed form.

1. Modify the Sum component to take a third property - "units" or "label" and to show that label after its total. e.g. if the label property is miles, `10 + 2 = 12 miles`.

1. (After making sure all is committed), extract out the components such as Greeting and TVEpisode into separate files - one per component.

1. Make a component that does something conditionally - e.g. shows a hot or cold emoji given a temperature.

1. Rewrite greeting to take an array of names to greet,displaying a ul populated with one li element per name. (you'll need to use a loop to build up an array prior to the return statement, or - harder but much more common - you can inline an expression based around array.map. )

1. Write an TVEpisodesList component that takes an array of episodes and shows all of them, delegating work to the TVEpisode component to build the HTML for each episode.
